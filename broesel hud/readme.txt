This is a modded version of broesel HUD.

On the front end, not much has changed despite the font
being replaced with the old surface font. However, behind
the scenes, a bunch of things have been removed to improve
overall performance of the game. Those things being:

- Removed friends list from game menu's. These have been
known to cause stutters when they update on some machines.

- Removed casual rank badge and progress bar. This lags the
game when it updates.

- Removed killstreak counter just to remove as many unnecessary
elements that can update mid-game to lessen as many stutters
as possible.

- Casual XP received and sounds. This has been known to cause
massive game stutters and hitches when it decides to update and
it tends to re-update every time you open your game menu.

- Halloween souls visuals and sounds. This tends to rape your FPS
in some instances.

I also replaced the Mercenary badge with the Cheater's Lament
because I wanted to see if it could be done and it can. It has a
custom language file to replace the name of the Mercenary Badge
with that of the Cheater's Lament. Same with the item description.

Explosion smoke has also been replaced with the spy sapper effect.
Doesn't increase FPS but it increases overall visibility.
